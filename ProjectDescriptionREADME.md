Project Description: Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) Prototype

A web-based tool called the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) was created to make it easier for Independent Contractor lecturers to submit, review, and approve monthly claims. By enabling lecturers to file claims based on hours worked, attach supporting documentation, and monitor the progress of their claims, the system streamlines administrative duties. Claims can be examined, validated, and approved by academic managers and program coordinators, who can also ensure process efficiency and responsibility.

The main goal of this project is to use C#.NET Core to construct a prototype for the CMCS. The prototype has the following components:

1. UML Class Diagram: An illustration of the database structure of the system, showing important entities as Lecturer, Claim, and Approvers.
2. GUI Design: Model-View-Controller was used to provide an intuitive user interface for the submission and approval of claims.
3. Project Plan: A thorough schedule describing the procedures needed to create the system prototype. 

First, the CMCS prototype aims to produce a functional design that serves as a foundation for further development. Stakeholders will be able to examine the system's structure and layout prior to the complete implementation phase, as the emphasis will be on the user interface and visual design rather than functionality. Through automation and smooth document handling, this prototype seeks to show how the CMCS would enhance user happiness and aid in the effective management of claims.

Project Objectives: 
•	Develop an organised and understandable UML class diagram to show the structure of the system.
•	Design a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing interface for submitting and approving claims.
•	Create a project plan outlining the duties and schedule for developing the prototype.

This prototype will work as a basis for the development of a complete Contract Monthly Claim System, with the goal of enhancing administrative effectiveness and productivity in the handling of claims by lecturers.
